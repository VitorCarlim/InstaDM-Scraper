## 📝 What is InstaDM-Scraper?

InstaDM-Scraper is a browser-based tool that helps you save your Instagram direct messages (DMs). It works by running simple code in your web browser. You do not need any special apps, extensions, or keys. Just your browser and a few clicks. The tool extracts your full chat history, including message timestamps, who sent what, reactions, media labels, and story replies. It works well even with long chats that load slowly.

This tool is useful if you want to keep a backup of your Instagram conversations or review message history outside of the Instagram app.

## 💻 System Requirements

InstaDM-Scraper runs inside your web browser. You need:

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- A modern web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge, updated to the latest version
- An internet connection to log into Instagram and download conversation data
- Basic knowledge of how to open browser developer tools (detailed steps are below)

No installation of extra software is needed.

## 🚀 Getting Started: How to Use InstaDM-Scraper

Follow these steps carefully to export your Instagram DMs.

### Step 1: Log into Instagram

Open your chosen web browser and go to [https://www.instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com). Sign in with your username and password as usual. Make sure you can see your Instagram feed and your direct messages.

### Step 2: Open Instagram Direct Messages

In Instagram’s top right corner, click the paper plane icon or the Messenger icon to open your DM inbox. This will show a list of your current chats.

### Step 3: Open Browser Developer Tools Console

Next, you need to open your browser’s developer tools console. This is where you will paste the InstaDM-Scraper code.

- **Chrome:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + J` (Mac)  
- **Firefox:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + K` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + K` (Mac)  
- **Edge:** Press `F12`, then select the Console tab  

You will see a panel that looks like a blank text area. This is the Console.

### Step 4: Load the InstaDM-Scraper Script

1. Visit the [InstaDM-Scraper releases page](https://github.com/VitorCarlim/InstaDM-Scraper/releases).  
2. Look for the latest release and find the JavaScript file or instructions to copy the script code.  
3. Copy the entire script provided for running in the Console.  

### Step 5: Paste and Run the Script in Console

Return to the Instagram direct messages page and the open Console panel. Paste the copied JavaScript code right into the Console input. Press `Enter` to run it.

The script will start extracting your message history. It may take some time if you have many conversations. InstaDM-Scraper uses virtual scrolling inside Instagram to load everything for export.

### Step 6: Save Your Exported Messages

Once finished, the tool will create a file or display your data in a way that you can save it. Usually, this is a JSON or text file with all your chats, timestamps, message senders, reactions, media labels, and story replies clearly logged.

Right-click the output link or use the prompt instructions to save the file to your computer. Choose a folder you will remember.

## 📥 Download & Install

Remember, InstaDM-Scraper does not require traditional installation. You only need the script file or instructions from the release page.

### How to Download

- Visit the official [InstaDM-Scraper releases page](https://github.com/VitorCarlim/InstaDM-Scraper/releases).
- Look for the latest version. The release page may contain a downloadable JavaScript file or step-by-step instructions.
- Download any available files if provided, or copy the provided JavaScript code directly.
- No software installer or extra setup is needed.

The tool runs entirely in the browser using DevTools Console.

## 🔑 Features

InstaDM-Scraper offers:

- Export your Instagram DM history with timestamps  
- Detect who sent each message  
- Support for story replies and message reactions  
- Labels for media items such as photos and videos  
- Works with virtual scrolling (loads older chats automatically)  
- No need for API keys, extensions, or third-party software  
- Runs directly in your browser’s console for easy use  
- Free and open source  

## ⚙️ How It Works

Behind the scenes, InstaDM-Scraper runs JavaScript code inside your browser’s developer console. This code interacts with the Instagram website as you navigate messages. It scrolls through your chat list automatically, loading older messages. The code detects message content, sender info, and extras like reactions and media tags. It organizes all this data into a file that you can save on your device.

Since it uses Instagram’s own web interface, no separate Instagram API or authentication steps are needed beyond your normal login.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Tips

- Make sure you are logged into Instagram before running the script.  
- Run the script on the Instagram Messages page only.  
- If you have large chats, the export may take several minutes. Wait patiently.  
- Close other browser tabs or apps that may slow your computer.  
- If the script does not run, check that you copied all the code exactly.  
- Use a supported browser like Chrome for best results.  
- Refresh Instagram and try again if you get errors.  

## 🔒 Privacy and Security

InstaDM-Scraper runs all its operations on your own computer within your browser. Your Instagram login credentials never leave your browser window. The exported data stays on your device only.

No external servers or third parties receive your messages. This makes the process private and secure.
